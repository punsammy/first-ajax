# Your First (Several) Asynchronous Requests

[See assignment in Alexa.](https://alexa.bitmaker.co/cohorts/67/assignments/2055/latest)

The server you will be interacting with is deployed at:

http://first-ajax-api.herokuapp.com/
The URLs within the server (AKA 'endpoints', AKA 'resources') we're going to work with are:

/ <- the root path
/ping
/pong
/count
/time
/a_car

Each time you use one of these paths, you will have to use the fully-qualified URL. For example: http://first-ajax-api.herokuapp.com/count
